## What is Uproot

Uproot is an I/O (Input/Output) library for reading and writing ROOT files into Pure Python and Numpy so that you don't need to import ROOT in Python.
That helps with saving both time and space and all you need to do in to install and import Uproot.

For additional information on how this library works and how to install, see [Uproot_Documentation](https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


Uproot helps with the data reduction prossedure. You might run into problems like long run times and slow for loops using ROOT uploaded in Python but Uproot is here to help with that.
